## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Set up virtual environment** (already created):
   ```bash
   # Virtual environment is already configured at .venv
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (already installed):
   ```bash
   # Dependencies are already installed in the virtual environment
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   C:/Users/Kapil/OneDrive/Desktop/CUBE/.venv/Scripts/python.exe run.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Use the default admin credentials:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin123`

## Default Configuration

### Default Roles
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management
- **Manager**: Create/manage work orders, view reports
- **Technician**: View and update assigned work orders

### Default Priorities
- **Low** (Green): Routine tasks
- **Medium** (Yellow): Standard priority
- **High** (Orange): Important tasks
- **Critical** (Red): Urgent/emergency tasks

### Default Statuses
